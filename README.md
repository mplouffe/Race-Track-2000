# Race-Track-2000
-----------------

A simulated horse racing betting website.
Race results are simulated server side and replayed on client side.

Uses PHP back end with extensive JavaScript for client side display of racing results.

Written a while ago and could use a good overhaul, especially the UI. Site is minimally responsive thanks to Bootstrap.
Not currently mobile friendly.

NOTE: This build is missing the data/connect.php file as this contains the db credentials for the live site.
